# Result-Processing-System
This software is primarily aimed for schools and colleges to evaluate the performances of both students and teachers. The system can generate performance reports such as progress reports, merit lists, etc. for both students and teachers.

Merit listing is done for individual subjects by totaling marks for a class. Student performance in every subject can be processed. Also, teachers’ performance for various classes and subjects can be compared.

Existing System:

In the manual student result processing system, all the database commands have to typed by the users. This procedure is very time consuming, and is limited to a single system. If someone want to get information about a particular subject score, teacher’s performance or any other contact, they have to contact the administrator handling the system.

Proposed System:

In the proposed system, there are various controls to provide user friendliness. Details can be accessed over the internet, and huge amount of data, records and information can be stored. It provides high level of security, and there is no risk of data mismanagement.  The overall result processing system is easier, flexible and requires less time.
